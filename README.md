# Drive
The premmise of the game is to drive.
That's it. It sounds so boring, only people with holes in their brain would play this.

We literally made because we got fustrated at The Long Drives crappy multiplayer.

Also I wanna keep updaing this and if you wanna get involved and have something to contribute shoot me a message.

Here are some images:
(put some images here bozo)

To do
- Get rid of log book
- Add some enemies
- Make the bed actually work
- Update food to actually heal the player
- Limit inventory size to just hotbar
- Custom tunable radio with different stations at different frequencies
- Better player movement may not be possible now, but as soon as we modders can change it, it's changing

Larger scope/experimental stuff (some pretty insane ideas here, don't take them too seriously)
- Remove the ability to destroy things, players can still pick up/place blocks but everything else has to be welded, separate shapes by hitting them with a hammer
- Speedometer (shows speed of body in actual model)
- Distance meter (same as speedometer but shows how many worlds it has been through or something)
- Give engines a fuel meter that can be checked with a fuel gague (connected with connector tool), and add a system where fuel canisters can be filled/emptied (will probably have to just use stack size as fill amount)
- Show players body and lock the game to first person (as god intended)
- Separate steering wheel from seat (connected to seat with connector tool) to put more focus on making visually interesting and usable cars
- Disable lift for more punishing experience
